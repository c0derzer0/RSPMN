Domain Description:

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Skill Teaching Domain 
//
// In the SkillTeaching MDP domain, the agent is trying to teach a series 
// of skills to a student through the use of hints and multiple choice
// questions.  The student has a proficiency level for each skill, which 
// indicates his ability to answer questions of that skill and positive
// reward is given for high proficiency on skills while negative reward 
// is given for low proficiency.  Each skill also has a weight on 
// how much it is worth. 
//
//  Many of the skills are connected in that some are
// ``pre-conditions'' of others.  If all of a skill's 
// pre-conditions are learned, the student has some probability 
// of answering questions about it right, and each precondition
// that is at high proficiency adds to the probability though 
// knowing all of them can lead to a probability higher than the sum
// of the components.  Hints only work if all the preconditions 
// are known and can only get you to medium proficiency.
//
// student proficiency increases with questions answered right and 
// decreases with questions about a skill answered wrong and 
// sometimes decreases by chance.
//
// To model the teacher-student interaction, every other step in the
// domain is the student's turn, where they answer a question.  
//
// The planning problems here are:
// 1) Whether or not to teach all the prerequisites of a skill before
//    teaching it.
// 2) What skill to focus on next
// 3) When to give hints and when to use multiple choice problems
