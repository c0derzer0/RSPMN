Domain Description:

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Elevator Domain
//
// The "elevators" domain has a number of elevators delivering passengers 
// to either the top or the bottom floor (the only allowable destinations).
// Potential passengers arrive at a floor based on Bernoulli draws 
// with a potentially different arrival probability for each floor.  
//
// The elevator can move in its current direction if the doors are closed,
// can remain stationary (noop), or can open its door while indicating
// the direction that it will go in next (this allows potential passengers
// to determine whether to board or not).  Note that the elevator can only
// change direction by opening its door while indicating the opposite 
// direction. 
//
// A passable plan in this domain is to pick up a passenger every time 
// they appear and take them to their destination.  A better plan includes 
// having the elevator "hover" near floors where passengers are likely to 
// arrive and coordinating multiple elevators for up and down passengers.
//
// This domain was designed to support extension to multiple elevators
// and may be used in either single or multi-elevator mode.
